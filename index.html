        </div>
        <div class="date">August 2018</div>
        <div class="details">
          Participated in the <a href="https://hackalong.devpost.com/?ref_content=default&ref_feature=challenge&ref_medium=discover">2018 Twitch Hackalong</a> with a team that built a Game Bot for Discord. The bot listens for user commands and performs actions if the commands are valid. It leverages the Discord Bot API and was built in under 15 hours.<br><br>

          The game is based on the classic Hot Potato game. Players pass the ignited Botato to each other. If the Botato "blows up", the user "dies" and the game ends with a GIF and wall of text that notifies the chat who was holding the Botato last.<br><br>

        <div class="date">November 2017</div>
        <div class="details">
          Designed and implemented a Smart Bot for use by the DevLeague community. The bot accepts a user query, passes the message through a natural language processor (Wit.ai), and displays database information based on the contents of the query. Useable in the browser and Slack!<br><br>

          I taught myself how to use Wit.ai and integrated it with Slack's API through Botkit. I used a similar integration through Node and React in the browser implementation. All of Devvy's knowledge is stored on a Postgres database.<br><br>
